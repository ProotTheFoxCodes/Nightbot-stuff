It's just as the description says! Some nightbot commands I made :)
## Contributions
bug fix for deltarune tommorow command provided by [niqofdez](https://community.nightdev.com/u/niqofdez/summary) on the NightDev Community forums. if you're making a command and there's a problem you can't get your head around, go ask there :3c
## Plans for future commands
* A command template that returns a value from a json file correspending to the key inputted in the command, which could be used for a wide variety of things.
  * Speedrunners could use it to have one command that allows chatters to get their PB in every category of the game they run.
    * For example, `!pb TPEG` could return the streamer's Personal Best in True Pacifist Ending Glitchless, a speedrun category from Undertale.
  * A streamer that's doing a subathon could set up this template so that chatters could have one command to find out the reward for any donation type
    * Example: `!reward cheer500` could return something like `Cheer 500 bits to add an hour to the timer, and have a chance of winning a free shirt (no purchase necessary)`
  * The most useful possibility for this could be to have one command to get a link for any social media the streamer has. You probably get the idea from the other examples x)
* A command that can set up the previous command for you, only needing the URL for the json file as input. Due to limitations, the json file would need to be <= 400 characters.
* A command that can pull a user's pronouns from [Twitch Chat Pronouns](https://pr.alejo.io), for people that don't have or don't want to get the browser extension or FrankerFaceZ plugin.
* A command that adds commands from a GitHub repo automatically.
